#About 
This weather web app was crafted using React. On launching the application, it will trigger JavaScript to ask the user for permission 
to access the user's location. With that information, the app is able to render real time
weather information of that location to the end user. In addition to that, the user can search for other locations and also access
their real time weather information.

#Other toosl
I made use of Redux for state management and of course used the popular openweather api to fetch real time weather data

A live version of the app can be found here
